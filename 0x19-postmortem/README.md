# Postmortem: Authentication Service Outage - March 1, 2025

## Issue Summary
- **Duration**: 2 hours and 37 minutes (March 1, 2025, 14:22 - 16:59 UTC)
- **Impact**: Authentication service failure prevented 74% of users from logging into our e-commerce platform. New users were unable to register accounts, and existing users couldn't access their profiles, cart information, or complete purchases. The checkout functionality remained completely unavailable to affected users.
- **Root Cause**: A memory leak in the authentication microservice caused by an improperly configured connection pool following a recent deployment.

## Timeline
- **14:22 UTC** - Issue began when the updated authentication service was deployed to production
- **14:27 UTC** - Monitoring system triggered alerts for increased response times on authentication endpoints
- **14:32 UTC** - Engineering team noticed spike in HTTP 503 errors on the authentication service
- **14:40 UTC** - Initial assumption was high traffic volume due to weekend sale promotion
- **14:55 UTC** - Added additional capacity by scaling the service horizontally, but errors persisted
- **15:10 UTC** - Investigation shifted to recent deployment after logs showed memory utilization approaching 100%
- **15:25 UTC** - Database team was consulted on potential connection issues between service and user database
- **15:40 UTC** - Root cause identified: memory leak in connection pooling configuration
- **16:15 UTC** - Fix implemented with proper connection pool settings and deployed to staging
- **16:30 UTC** - Fix verified in staging environment
- **16:45 UTC** - Fix deployed to production
- **16:59 UTC** - Service fully restored, error rates returned to normal levels

## Root Cause and Resolution
The authentication service was experiencing a memory leak due to an improperly configured connection pool following a deployment earlier that day. The updated code included a database connection pooling configuration that failed to properly close idle connections. Each new authentication request created additional connections that were not being released back to the pool, gradually consuming all available memory resources.

The issue was resolved by correcting the connection pool configuration to properly manage connection lifecycles. Specifically, we adjusted the maximum pool size, connection timeout parameters, and implemented proper connection release mechanisms. This prevented the service from leaking memory and restored normal authentication functionality.

## Corrective and Preventative Measures
### Improvements Needed:
1. Enhance pre-deployment testing for resource utilization issues
2. Improve monitoring for connection pool metrics
3. Implement gradual rollout strategy for critical services
4. Develop more comprehensive rollback procedures

### Specific Tasks:
1. Add memory utilization tests to CI/CD pipeline for authentication service
2. Configure connection pool monitoring with specific alerts for connection counts exceeding thresholds
3. Implement canary deployments for the authentication service to detect issues before full rollout
4. Create automated rollback script triggered by specific error thresholds
5. Update deployment checklist to include verification of connection pool configurations
6. Schedule knowledge-sharing session on connection pool best practices for all development teams
7. Update documentation for proper connection pool configuration
8. Add circuit-breaker pattern to authentication service to prevent cascading failures
